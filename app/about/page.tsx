                  Career
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Software Engineer at{" "}
                  <b>EuroAccident AB Sweden</b>. Here, I focus on web development,
                  leveraging technologies like React, GraphQL, and Microsoft
                  Azure. Iâ€™m heavily involved in creating high-performing,
                  responsive websites, all within an Agile environment. My work
                  doesnâ€™t stop at codingâ€”I also take pride in leading and
                  collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring innovative
                  solutions to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before joining EuroAccident, I was a <b>Senior Frontend Web
                  Engineer</b> at <b>Nets AB Sweden</b>, where I played a key role in
                  developing a custom platform for technical documentation
                  across the Nexi group. As part of the Relay team, I
                  contributed to building a next-gen distributed payment
                  processing system, which was a fantastic experience to dive
                  deeper into backend technologies and work with a cutting-edge
                  tech stack on Azure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My journey into consulting as a <b>Full-Stack JavaScript
                  Developer</b> with <b>School of Applied Technology</b> allowed me
                  to tackle diverse projects for clients like Footway AB and
                  QBank AB. Working with the MERN and JAM stacks, I embraced
                  Agile methodologies and collaborated closely with my teams
                  through Scrum, Mob Programming, and Pair Programming. These
                  experiences sharpened my skills and broadened my perspective
                  on web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started my career as a <b>Frontend Web Developer</b> at 
                  <b>Svenska DomÃ¤ner AB Sweden</b>, where I focused on designing
                  and implementing customer-facing features. It was here that I
                  built a strong foundation in web technologies, working with
                  PHP, SQL, Symfony, and various JavaScript frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve been driven by a love for
                  technology and a desire to continuously learn and grow.
                  Whether itâ€™s improving existing systems or building something
                  new from scratch, Iâ€™m always ready to take on the next
                  challenge.
