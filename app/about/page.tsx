                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Currently, I‚Äôm working as a Software Engineer at{" "}
                    <b>EuroAccident AB Sweden</b>. Here, I focus on web
                    development, leveraging technologies like React, GraphQL,
                    and Microsoft Azure. I‚Äôm heavily involved in creating
                    high-performing, responsive websites, all within an Agile
                    environment. My work doesn‚Äôt stop at coding‚ÄîI also take
                    pride in leading and collaborating with cross-functional
                    teams to bring innovative solutions to life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before joining EuroAccident, I was a{" "}
                    <b>Senior Frontend Web Engineer</b> at <b>Nets AB Sweden</b>
                    , where I played a key role in developing a custom platform
                    for technical documentation across the Nexi group. As part
                    of the Relay team, I contributed to building a next-gen
                    distributed payment processing system, which was a fantastic
                    experience to dive deeper into backend technologies and work
                    with a cutting-edge tech stack on Azure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My journey into consulting as a{" "}
                    <b>Full-Stack JavaScript Developer</b> with{" "}
                    <b>School of Applied Technology</b> allowed me to tackle
                    diverse projects for clients like Footway AB and QBank AB.
                    Working with the MERN and JAM stacks, I embraced Agile
                    methodologies and collaborated closely with my teams through
                    Scrum, Mob Programming, and Pair Programming. These
                    experiences sharpened my skills and broadened my perspective
                    on web development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I started my career as a <b>Frontend Web Developer</b> at
                    <b>Svenska Dom√§ner AB Sweden</b>, where I focused on
                    designing and implementing customer-facing features. It was
                    here that I built a strong foundation in web technologies,
                    working with PHP, SQL, Symfony, and various JavaScript
                    frameworks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout my career, I‚Äôve been driven by a love for
                    technology and a desire to continuously learn and grow.
                    Whether it‚Äôs improving existing systems or building
                    something new from scratch, I‚Äôm always ready to take on the
                    next challenge.
