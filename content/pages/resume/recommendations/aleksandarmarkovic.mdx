During the course of 18 months he has been a part of the development team that have successfully completed several projects involving mostly frontend functionality. Very adaptive, goal oriented and delivers on time. Self going and ready to take initiative. Learns new things with ease and applies them correctly. Detailed, thorough and analytical. Selfless and always ready to help colleagues. Highly recommend him for any development position especially where collaboration is expected.
