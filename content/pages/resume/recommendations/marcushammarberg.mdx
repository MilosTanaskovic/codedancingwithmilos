I had the joy to meet and see Milos in action in our boot camp at Salt. 

The boot camp is very though but Milos seemed to meet every day with smile and time over to cheer on his team mates. 
Not only that, but Milos is one of the very few developers that have asked me for more exercises to deepen his technical knowledge and skills - which was considerable going in.

On top of that Milos have that rare air of spreading encouragement around him across the company. 

I'd love to have Milos be a part in any project / endavour that I go into.
