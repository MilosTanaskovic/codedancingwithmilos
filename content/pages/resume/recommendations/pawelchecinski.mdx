Milos is a skilled developer with a very professional attitude. Everything he does, he handles with same high level of commitment, and you can always count on him.
He’s an expert in frontend but is not afraid to get “his hands dirty” in the backend components, build pipelines or environment configuration. One can virtually throw any task at him – he takes everything as a challenge and a great opportunity to learn even more. A true full stack developer!
His enthusiasm is contagious – he’s always full ideas and new solutions. He not only completes his assignments but helps others and finds time to share his knowledge in any way possible.
A fantastic team player who brings value on so many levels!
