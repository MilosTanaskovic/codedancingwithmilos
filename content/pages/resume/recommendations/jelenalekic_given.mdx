From initial contact to the delivery of photos, Jelena went above and beyond. She honored the process of input and approached me as a collaborator in my headshot process. She asked thoughtful questions about my needs and goals, then proposed a very intentionally crafted process to meet them. I had so much fun at our photoshoot! Jelena created a relaxing environment. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Jelena Lekic and highly recommend you consider Cozy Studio Belgrade for all your photography needs.
