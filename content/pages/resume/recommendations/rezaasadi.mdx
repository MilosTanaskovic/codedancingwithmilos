I highly recommend my friend Milos as a skilled developer. We worked together for 13 weeks and during that time, I was consistently impressed by his technical abilities and attention to detail. He has an excellent eye for application architecture and is able to identify and solve complex problems with ease. He is a great team player and is always willing to go the extra mile to ensure the success of a project. He also has a great ability to keep the team atmosphere positive and make you smile, even in tough situations. I have no doubt that he would be an asset to any organization.
