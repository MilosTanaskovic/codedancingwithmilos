We have been working together with Milos in one team on a big UX project: developer (technical documentation) portal for Nexi group: https://developer.nexigroup.com/. Milos has implemented new company design system according to Atomic principles, Tailwind CSS library, as well as delivered new features such as the feedback tool, support page functionality, rendering gRPC type of APIs and many other smaller improvements and maintenance. 

It is a pleasure to work together with Milos as one team: exceptional collaboration, steadfast support and outstanding deliveries. We have worked out the best ways of working based on Agile/scrum principals. Milos always eagers to share the knowledge with the team and is very good in explaining technical things to the non-tech audience.
