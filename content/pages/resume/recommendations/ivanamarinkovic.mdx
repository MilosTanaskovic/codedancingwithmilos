Milos and I have been working together at Nexi/Nets for almost a year now. As we both belong to a relatively small team, it is easy to get to know our colleagues well and observe their work daily.

Day to day, without exception, I can see that Milos gives 100% to the team. His dedication and persistence are admirable. Anytime I would ask for his help or opinion, he would always reply within minutes and give very helpful and constructive insights.

I am privileged to be working with someone so professional and knowledgeable. Milos is the kind of person who honestly enjoys both learning and teaching. He is more than happy to share any knowledge and do it in a very structured way. At the same time, he is open-minded and eager for new experiences.
