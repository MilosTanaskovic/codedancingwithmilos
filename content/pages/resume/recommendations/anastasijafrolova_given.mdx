I am writing to extend my wholehearted recommendation for Anastasija, who has been an integral Product Manager within our Developer Documentation team at Nets E-Commerce, part of the Nets|Nexi Group. Having collaborated closely with Anastasija for over a year on the Developer Documentation Portal, I have witnessed first-hand her exceptional capabilities and dedication to enhancing the customer experience.
 
Anastasijaâ€™s background in product management and her unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction have been pivotal in the evolution of our Developer Documentation Portal (developer.nexigroup.com). This portal serves as a comprehensive resource, centralizing all Nexi Group products' technical documentation in a single, accessible location. Anastasija's leadership in this project has significantly contributed to simplifying the operations for our merchants and providing an invaluable tool for developers integrating with Nexi's payment solutions.
