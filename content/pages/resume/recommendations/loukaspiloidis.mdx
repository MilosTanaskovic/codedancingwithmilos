I have worked with Milos in 2022 in Salt. He is a real professional in everything he does. His knowledge on anything technical is as impressive as his enthusiasm. We have an excellent relationship and I always consider him as one of the go-to people when I want an expert opinion in a technical problem. I recommend him 100%.
