I had the pleasure of closely collaborating with Milos across several initiatives at Nets (part of Nexi group). We notably implemented a new support platform and revamped the overall user experience structure while spearheading the development of Nexi Group's developer documentation portal from the ground up, which hosted all products within the Nexi network.

Milos is not only quick on his feet but also an outstanding dance partner when it comes to swiftly adapting to all user-centered focused scenarios. Working with him has been a dream for me as a product designer.
