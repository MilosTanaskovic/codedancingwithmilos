I  had the pleasure of working with Milos in our consulting assingment at Footway. He is full of positive energy, enthusiasm and a can do attitude. He is not afraid of jumping into new things and learn something on the way. He is a great team player, fits in very well with any croud and adapts very quickly in changing environment. I am happy we had the chance to work together.
